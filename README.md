## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a simple and fun game played between two players who take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. This project leverages the minimax algorithm, a popular AI strategy, to create an intelligent Tic Tac Toe player that cannot be defeated.

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI**: Uses the minimax algorithm to ensure the AI always makes the optimal move.
- **Clean and Modular Code**: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it suitable for further modifications and enhancements.
- **Detailed Comments**: The code is thoroughly commented to help you understand each function and its purpose.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
